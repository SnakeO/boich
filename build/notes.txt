I added in a scrollbar in some sections. You can see how it will work with text that is too large to fit.

Any pages that I did not have images for, I used a picture of grapes with a question mark on it. Note: the image size is 666x564

Check out the "terms & conditions" page @ http://boich.otleylogic.com/build/terms-and-conditions.php 
At the top thre is the title that says "Terms and Conditions", but the contrast of the text color with the background makes it hard to read.

Can you provide your facebook / twitter links? 

Can you provide me with a few more backgrounds to use, and I will show backgrounds switching between pages.

The site will show nicely on iPad, iPhone, and android phones. Please test on them if you have them.
