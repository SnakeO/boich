													<h1>2012 Cabernet Sauvignon â€“ Beckstoffer George III Vineyard, G Block</h1>
													<p>Winemakers in Napa Valley were not only elated by the quality of the 2012 harvest, but many see the excellence that supersedes past vintages going back decades.  A mild spring led to a good fruit set, summer and fall brought warm temperatures, but no heat waves. All the fruit enjoyed a long, slow ripening. Early indications are that Cabernets will be dark, rich and age worthy, inviting comparisons with 2001 and 2007. For the past two decades Napa Valley has had only two vintages that have ranked above 95 points (1997 & 2001), 2012 will most certainly be added to the list of spectacular Napa vintages.</p>
													<p>Boich Family Cellar harvested 4 tons from the G block in the Beckstoffer George III vineyard on October 26th, 2012. The fruit was perfectly ripe at 25.9 brix. We used two varieties of French oak for our barrel aging, Darnajou and Taransaud. The Darnajou brings an element of spice and cloves where the Taransaud adds some firm tannins and a darker/espresso quality to the wine.  The 2 combined complement each other beautifully.</p>
													<p>Total production will be 250 cases, bottling is expected in the second half of 2014. Boich Family Cellar will be allocating 100 cases of the 250 to founding members, friends and family. The remaining 150 cases will be held in library for future release.</p>
