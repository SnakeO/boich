													<h1>Beckstoffer George III - Rutherford</h1>
													<p>Historical records show that a portion of this vineyard was planted in 1895 by Mrs. Thomas Rutherford. This 300-acre parcel first purchased by Beaulieu founder Georges de Latour in 1928 and called Beaulieu Vineyard Number 3, was the home to BV’s Rutherford Cabernets made by the renowned winemaker Andre Tchelistcheff. These wines achieved wide acclaim in the 1960’s and 70’s, establishing BV’s pre-eminence in the making of fine Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon. Purchased by Beckstoffer Vineyards in 1988, the vineyard has since been replanted using new Cabernet Sauvignon clones with tighter spacing and advanced trellising systems, enhancing both quality and grape tonnage. In 2009, 181 acres were placed under a land conservation easement that forever prohibits non-agricultural development. Vineyard Georges III is today home to the main offices of Beckstoffer Vineyards.</p>

													<h1>Wall Road Vineyard – Mount Veeder</h1>
													<p>Mount Veeder, bordering Napa Valley to the west, is a one-of-a-kind appellation. Steep slopes render shallow topsoil and minimal water retention, resulting in tiny berries, with intensely concentrated yet soft tannins. The soil composition within the Wall Vineyard is complicated, changing from cobble rock to rich deep alluvium to moderate clay; some moderately sloped to other parts steep.  The entire vineyard has remarkably quick drainage which allows for controlled stress on the vines.  The afternoon coastal influence keeps the vineyards cool during the heat of the day yet allows for full ripeness at harvest time.  At an elevation of 1800 feet, the vines start later than valley vineyards but ripen earlier thereby shorting the growing season.  This shorter growing cycle preserves and enhances the fruit complexity.</p>
