													<h1>Winemaking</h1>
													<p>They say that “great wine is made in the vineyard” but amazing fruit can only be transformed into remarkable wine by a talented and passionate wine maker like Jeff Ames. Having been in the industry only 20 years and having been a resident in Napa since 1999, Jeff, along with former winemaking colleague Thomas Brown, has the distinction of having crafted more 100 point Napa Cabs than any other winemaker in the valley - an extraordinary accomplishment in a wine making region that is home to some of the best in the business. Jeff has established an impressive track record, working with some of the finest Napa fruit, on wine making projects at Schrader, Outpost, Maybach and Tor Kenward. In addition to these projects, Jeff  has consistently produced outstanding wine from his own label Rudius. Jeff’s extraordinary attention to detail, experienced palate and straight forward philosophy to wine making make him the perfect craftsman to shepherd the Boich Family fruit from vineyard to table in the form of truly remarkable, memorable wine.</p>

													<h1>Wine Maker Jeff Ames - Style &amp; philosophy</h1>
													<p>The very best wines all begin with the very best fruit. This is why my approach to winemaking focuses on procuring the best fruit possible and once you have it get the heck out of the way.  You cannot force a wine in a direction it is not meant to go.  The very finest wines are a rare gift from Mother Nature and can never be replicated through labs or engineering. A good winemaker understands this and never attempts to alter the natural course. This is not to say that crafting a 100 point Napa Cab is effortless, quite the contrary. The wine making process is a never ending quest to understand your vineyard and how best to shepherd your harvest from the vineyard to the bottle and get the most from your fruit. Although some continue their attempt to engineer the perfect wine – it will never come to fruition. Wine making is an art subject to the whims of nature not a science. And that will never change. At the end of the day people sometimes forget that the purpose of fine wine is for it to taste great - simple as that.</p>
													<p>The Boich Family Cellar George III fruit and the Wall Road/Mt Veeder fruit make very different wines.  The GIII fruit, being from the valley floor, has plush, round and very smooth tannins.  The Wall Road fruit coming from Mt. Veeder is broad shouldered and structured.  The GIII will age well but not as well as the Wall Road fruit.  If our customers are looking for something to pour in the first 2-5 years after bottling they will likely want to reach for the GIII. But if they are looking to lay a wine down for 5 to 10 years and know that when they come back to it will be extraordinary, they will want our Mt. Veeder wine.  Both wines begin with wonderful fruit and both result in remarkable Napa Cabernets.</p>
